## ðŸ‘‰  `Purpose of this Block`
- The purpose is to convert an existing classical shortcode into a Gutenberg Block.

## ðŸ‘‰  `Benefits of converting to a Block`
- No need to worry about remembering `shortcode` tag
- Just drop into the `editor` and start writing the content.
- Content will automatically get wrapped by desired container(s) when saved and rendered.
- Could be searched easily in `Inserter Dialog` by its Name or Keywords
- All Gutenberg Blocks are plugins, hence they are immediately available for all themes.

## ðŸ‘‰  `Screnshots`
- Searching the block in Inserter Dialog: https://prnt.sc/mernj7
- Block in placed in the `editor` and content is typed: https://prnt.sc/merpso
- Rendered output of the Shortcode block: https://prnt.sc/merr08  
(please ignore the background color for now. Gutenberg adds default classes. I am checking how I can get rid of it.)
- Rendered source:  
`<div class="wp-block-cgb-block-hall-gray-content gray-bg"><div class="constrain content"><p>The Block alternative for hall-gray-section is placed here. As can be seen we only need to write the content to go inside the wrapper.<br/><br/>We are able to create multiple paragraphs as well.</p></div></div></div>`
